        <h2>Meet Our Teams!</h2>
        <div class="columns">
            <p>We are home to an array of professional sports teams, spanning multiple major leagues for both men and women.</p>
            <p>On the ice, the Washington Capitals have sparked this city's hockey enthusiasm. 14 time division champions, 2 time conference champions, and a Stanley Cup in 2018. You can catch all-time great scorer Alexander Ovechkin and his teammates streaming up and down the ice at Capital One Arena.</p>
            <p>A change in ownership and team name were just the beginning of the revival for the Washington Commanders. After nearly a quarter of a decade of poor management and losing seasons, the Commanders have been rebuilding under new leadership and aiming for playoff contention.</p>
            <p>Your 2019 WNBA Champion Washington Mystics now find their home at the CareFirst Arena. Playing since 1998, come watch young stars and veterans take on the world's best women's basketball talent.</p>
            <p>The youngest team in the MLB, your Washington Nationals. After some lean years following expansion, the Nationals earned a wild card berth and went on a magical run to a World Series title.</p>
            <p>For you soccer fans, the Washington Spirit and DC United are here to put on a match. The NWSL's Spirit and MLS' United play at the incredible Audi Field. The two teams have combined for memorable matches and strong local support.</p>
            <p>The other resident of Capital One Arena, your Washington Wizards. 8 division titles, 4 conference championships, and an NBA title. Players like Wes Unseld, Gilbert Arenas, and Michael Jordan-era opponents have defined parts of the franchise's history.</p>
