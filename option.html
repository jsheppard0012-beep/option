        <h2>Meet Our Teams!</h2>
        <div class="columns">
            <p>We are home to an array of professional sports teams, spanning multiple major leagues for both men and women.</p>
            <p>On the ice, the Washington Capitals have sparked this city's hockey enthusiasm. 14 time division champions, 2 time conference champions, and a Stanley Cup in 2018. You can catch all-time goal scorer Alexander Ovechkin and his teammates screaming up and down the ice at Capital One Arena.</p>
            <p>A change in ownership and team name were just the beginning of the revival for the Washington Commanders. After nearly a quarter of a decade of poor management and losing seasons, the Commanders, led by their rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, made it to the NFC Championship game in 2025. 15 time division champs, 5 time conference champs, and 5 time league champions. With a new field coming in 2030, there is much to be excited about with our NFL franchise.</p>
            <p>Your 2019 WNBA Champion Washington Mystics now find their home at the CareFirst Arena. Playing since 1998, come watch 2nd year pros Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen take on the world's best womens players like A'ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu, and Caitlin Clark.</p>
            <p>The youngest team in the MLB, your Washington Nationals. After some lean years following expansion, the Nationals earned a wild card berth and went on a magical run to a World Series title. Come catch our young, talented squad on South Capital Street at Nationals Park as they aim for their next World Series title.</p>
            <p>For you soccer fans, the Washington Spirit and DC United are here to put on a match. The NWSL's Spirit and MLS' United play at the incredible Audi Field. The two teams have combined for 5 league championships, and have boasted numerous national team players.</p>
            <p>The other resident of Capital One Arena, your Washington Wizards. 8 division titles, 4 conference championships, and an NBA title. Players like Wes Unseld, Gilbert Arenas, Antwan Jamison, Juwan Howard, Chris Webber, and the greatest of all time Michael Jordan have adorned the Wizards jersey over it's rich history.</p>
